### 3D Printable parts

- There are a number of .STLs ready to print in the [*3d Print*](/Brackets/3D%20Print) directory. They include:
    - Brackets and hubs for the TT motor
    - Brackets  and shaft couplers for the stepper motor
    - Brackets for the servo
    - Some general mounting brackets

- All mounting holes are set on a 0.5 inch grid. All holes (except motor specific ones) are for M4 hardware
- There is also a [fusion file](/Fusion%20Files/Motor Brackets.f3d) that contains all models for easy modification
    - There are 3D models for the TT Motor, the Stepper Motor and the Servo which can be used to design other brackets and mounts

### Laser cut parts

- In the [*Laser Cut*](/Brackets/Laser%20Cut) directory there are two vector files for cutting interchangeable cams that mount onto the TT Hubs
    - The center sprocket should be cut out of 1/4" MDF
    - The cams themselves should be cut out of 1/4" acrylic
